My research is focused on improving and understanding the trustworthiness of AI architectures in computer vision and cyber-physical systems.
This is accomplished by facing safety and security aspects that may threaten the reliability of neural networks (adversarial attacks and defenses, robustness analysis against input perturbations, poisoning attacks, out-of-distribution detection, etc.).
