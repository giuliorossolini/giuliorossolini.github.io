My research is focus on improving and understanding the trustworthiness of AI architectures in computer vision and cyber-physical tasks.
This is accomplished by facing safety and security aspects that may thretened the reliability of neural networks, for instance: adversarial attacks and defenses; robustness analysis against image perturbations; poisoning; deep steganography.
