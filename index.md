<br>
I am an assistant professor at the Real-Time Systems Laboratory of Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Pisa. I received my Ph.D. in Emerging Digital Technologies in 2024, with a focus on safety and robustness issues in artificial intelligence algorithms for cyber-physical systems, under the supervision of Prof.<a href="http://retis.sssup.it/~giorgio/">Giorgio Buttazzo</a> and Prof.  <a href="https://retis.sssup.it/~a.biondi/">Alessandro Biondi</a>. 
   <br><br>
   My current research interests include designing and implementing software tools to enhance the trustworthiness of machine learning algorithms used in computer vision applications and distributed learning-enabled environments.

    <br><br>

From January 2023 to August 2023, I conducted a research visit at the Computer Vision Laboratory (CVLab) of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/mathieu.salzmann"> Mathieu Salzmann</a>, working on the robustness evaluation of self-attention architectures and adaptive learning strategies for autonomous driving tasks.
